      Well, back in the 2000s, I had a Windows 98 PC that had MS Paint. With the
      mouse and paintbrush tools, I used to play around. I even received some
      appreciation for my creations, so it stuck with me that I could do some
      'digital' art. ðŸ˜„

      Not too long ago, I recalled all of this and retrieved an old version of
      Paint. I then proceeded to create images of Thorin and Azog.

      In fact, I undertook this project to study HTML images and wrote this text
      because the first pictures I found on my PC were these two PNG images.
